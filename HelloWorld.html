		<h1> Section 1 </h1>
			HTML is easy.
		<h2> Section 2 </h2>
			Once you remember tags the rest is just typing.
		<h3> Section 3 </h3>
			Lists, menus, directories, & comments, are the next thing we will look at.
		<h4> Section 4 </h4>
			Next week we will look at tables, images, alignment and text wrapping.
		<h5> Section 5 </h5>
			The rest of the course is based on applying colours, backgrounds, marguees, links, animation & sound.
		<h6> Section 6 </h6>
			By the 15th of April I will be a HTML expert because that is when my assignment is.
